# Python String Creator

Python string concatination sucks. Period.

Let's make it easier.

## Syntax

Just type your ezString in string.txt. It looks like this:

##### Hello {variableName}. Did you know that 3 + {myvar} = {3+myvar}

EasyString automatically converts ints -> strings and strings -> ints when necessary. Additionally, you can add variables to variables and numbers to variables inside of {} to perform math automatically.

### Essentially, just surround variables with {}. Common math functions (+,-,/,*) can be done by just typing it in the {}. ({var1+var2})
